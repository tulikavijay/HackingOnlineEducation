## Overview
The use of the Web (World Wide Web) has had many positive effects on education. It overcomes time and space limitations in traditional schools. Teachers and students
are now using  the  Web  to  access  vast  amounts  of  information  and  resources  in  the cyberspace. Also, learning via the Web enables both synchronous and asynchronous communication. Despite of many  benefits  of  the  Web,  it  may  weaken  studentsâ€™ motivation  due  to  lack  of  face-to-face communication. I try to provide a learning model(website) called Hacking Online Education, which is based on the principles of MOOCs.

Aim of this Project is to develop a website that assists students and teachers alike to discover online courses, to enroll in courses from different sources, to compare these sources and to track their progress. Students can decide on their own pace and with which session they would like to begin their studies.

## Main Page
The main page or home page allows user to login/sign-up and showcases popular MOOCs and courses along with their rating.
